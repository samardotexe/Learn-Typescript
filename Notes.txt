-Typescript is interested in knowing the type of your assigned variable and it is tricty sticked to it 
and...
-example: 
(A is a number so it is a number you can't assign as string to it )

-All javascript is a valid typescript code

~How to configure it 
-To config TS file we have to use : tsc --Init / npx tsc --init
-To compile a TS file : tsc <file name> (It will create a js file where ts file will get compiled)
-To keep compiling : tsc --watch 

-TypeScript always compile the code but warns everytime

-Whenever we call a class. Constructor runs first
