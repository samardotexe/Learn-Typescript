Introduction 
1. typescript proivides type safety
2. in javasfcript you can define a variable without a type
3. in typescript you can define a variable with a type
ex. let user: string = "sam";
    let age: number = 30;

but in javascript we can define a variable without a type 

example : var user = "sam";
example : var user = 30;
the type of user isn't defined in javascript 

Typescript is interested in knowing the type of your assigned variable and it is tricty sticked to it 

(A is a number so it is a number you can't assign as string to it )

All javascript is a valid typescript code

To config TS file we have to use : tsc --Init / npx tsc --init

To compile a TS file : tsc <file name> (It will create a js file where ts file will get compiled)

To keep compiling : tsc --watch 

//Typescript
How to defined type
-Add :Type after variable name 
eg: let var:String = "Samar";




-Primitve types : Normal assingment to var

-Reference types : use {} []

-Primitive types can be copied to another variable but reference type can't be copied to another 

-Array is defined by type casting it ":number[] , :string[], :any[]"

-If multiple values are inside array we have to add ": [ number,string,boolean]" after variable name
